There are five ways for building a model based on the predictor variables

1. All in --> based on domain knowledge, we know we want to include each variable for the model

2. **Backward Elimination**
    a. Select a significance level to stay in the model
    b. Fit the model with all possible predictors
    c. Consider the predictor with the highest p-value. If p > SL, keep moving on, or else stop
    d. Remove the predictor
    e. Fit the Model without this predictor

3. Forward Selection  
    a. Select a significance model to enter the model
    b. Fit all simple regression models y -xn and select the one with the lowest p-value
    c. Keep this variable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor added to the ones we already have
    d. Consider the predictor with the lowest p value. If p < SL, go to STEP C, otherwise finish

4. Bidirectional Elimination
    a. Select a significance leve to enter and to stay in the model
    b. Perform all steps of Forward Selection (old vars must have P < SL to enter)
    c. Perform all steps of Backward Elimination (old vars must have P < SL to stay )
    d. No new variables can enter and no old variables can exist

5. All Possible models (Resource Heavy!!!)
    a. Select a criterion of goodness of fit
    b. Construct all possible regression models
    c. Select the one with the best criterion
